## Subway Tracker

This is a C++ ocmmand line app designed for tracking the subway in New York. It's primarily a way to learn how to code in C++ better, but who knows might be useful as well.

For now the output specification is a command line app that updates in realtime with subway data.

## Dependencies

This should be in a formal dpkg structure but for now:

* c++17
* Protobuf
* Apache Log4CXX


## Sources

* `*.proto` files are from https://api.mta.info/#/HelpDocument
* API reference is here: https://api.mta.info/GTFS.pdf
* protoc is from Google's primary protobuf repo
